# Data-Models-in-Database-Systems-Lecture
This repo is for what I did in lecture Data Models in Database Systems, tasks include my practical works and their code files and report files.

During my database studies , I engaged in practical assignments focused on data warehousing and storage structures. I successfully designed and implemented warehouses, creating ER diagrams, and leveraging constructions and object types to enhance data retrieval efficiency. These hands-on tasks included designing and implementing data storage structures, working with XML and JSON, and utilizing Oracle and MongoDB. This experience enriched my proficiency in database design, implementation, and diverse technology applications, providing a practical skill set for real-world scenarios.
